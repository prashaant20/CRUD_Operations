# CRUD_Operations_Overview
This Python script provides a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing sales records stored in a CSV file. It allows users to add new records, view existing records, update records, and delete records from the dataset.

# Script Overview

# Global Variables:

•	CSV_FILE: Holds the path to the CSV file where sales records are stored.

# Functions:

•	create_record(record): Appends a new record to the CSV file.  
•	read_records(): Reads and displays all records from the CSV file.  
•	update_record(record_id, updated_record): Updates an existing record in the CSV file.  
•	delete_record(record_id): Deletes a specific record from the CSV file.  

# Main Function (main()):

•	Displays a menu for CRUD operations.  
•	Based on user input, invokes corresponding functions (create_record, read_records, update_record, delete_record).  
•	Exits when the user chooses to exit (choice == '5').  

# Detailed Functionality:

•	create_record(record): Opens the CSV file in append mode and writes the new record using csv.writer.  
•	read_records(): Opens the CSV file in read mode and iterates over each row using csv.reader, printing each row formatted.  
•	update_record(record_id, updated_record): Reads the entire CSV file into memory, updates the specified record if found (record_id matches), and writes back the updated content to the CSV file.  
•	delete_record(record_id): Reads the entire CSV file into memory, removes the specified record if found (record_id matches), and writes back the modified content to the CSV file.  

# Improvements and Considerations:

•	Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage cases like invalid inputs, file permissions, etc.  
•	Data Validation: Validate user inputs (e.g., ensure numerical fields are numeric, date formats are correct).  
•	Performance Considerations: For larger datasets, consider alternative storage solutions or optimizations to reduce file I/O operations.  
•	CSV File Structure: Ensure the CSV file structure matches the expected format (ID, Date, Product, Quantity, Price).
